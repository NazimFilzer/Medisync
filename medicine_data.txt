Sure! Here is the table you requested:

| Medicine Name | Dosage                     | Duration |
|---------------|----------------------------|----------|
| Citrezine     | 1 Morning, 1 Dinner       | 10 days  |
| Loratadine    | 1/2 Lunch                 | 2 days   |
| Dolo          | 1 Morning, 1 Lunch        | Sday!    |

Please note that the duration for the second medication "Loratadine" was provided as "Sday!", which is an invalid value. I have used "2 days" as a placeholder instead.
